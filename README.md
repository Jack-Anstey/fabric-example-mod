# Custom Fabric Example Mod Fork

## About
This is a custom fork of [Fabric Example Mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod) to make it easier for first time modders to make sure that their
installations of Fabric are working properly. Includes a "basic" and "complex" item as examples with textures and
names.

This branch has fully completed mods and a completed folder structure. I wanted folks to be able to make mods on their own too which is why this is a seperate branch.

## Setup
For setup, check out the [Wiki](https://fabricmc.net/wiki/tutorial:setup) and follow the steps for your particular IDE. I reccomend IntelliJ as that is where
this code is written and executed.

## License
This uses the same CC0 license so please download and inspect the code if you would like to see if it works on your machine!
